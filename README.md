'Whether you believe it or not, accept it or not, you create your reality. When you try to change the events and world outside, you are trying to change the scene by jumping in front of the screen. To change the scene, you need to change the film being projected on the screen.'  
~ SPH HDH Sri Nithyananda Paramashivam

"Charya Pada -  lifestyle of Paramashiva  
Kriya Pada - methods, techniques relating connecting to vertical timezone beings, techniques to connect to Paramashiva

~ SPH HDH Kailasa's Sri Nithyananda Paramashivam
